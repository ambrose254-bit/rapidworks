# RapidWorks

RapidWorks is a Python application designed to offer a secure browsing environment by isolating internet activities from the rest of the Windows system. It creates a temporary sandbox environment where web browsing can be conducted safely.

## Features

- **Sandbox Environment**: Sets up a temporary directory to isolate browsing activities.
- **Secure Browsing**: Launches a web browser in a controlled environment.
- **Clean-Up**: Automatically removes the sandbox environment after the browsing session is completed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- An internet connection
- A web browser installed on the system

## Installation

To use RapidWorks, clone the repository to your local machine and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rapidworks.git
cd rapidworks
```

## Usage

Run the program using Python:

```bash
python rapidworks.py
```

This will create a sandbox environment and launch your default web browser to open a specified URL. You can modify the URL in the `main()` function of `rapidworks.py`.

## Limitations

- This is a basic implementation of sandboxing and may not provide full isolation like more advanced tools.
- Only supports launching the default web browser.

Note: This implementation provides a basic example of isolating browsing activities using Python. However, true sandboxing requires more advanced techniques and tools, such as using virtual machines or containers, which are beyond the scope of this simple script.
